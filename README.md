# Shortest-Path-Algorithms-Using-Python
Dijkstra Shortest Path algorithm is a greedy algorithm that assigns cost to each adjacent nodes by choosing the minimum element and finds the shortest distance from a given node to the terminal node. In this tutorial you will understand how Dijkstra algorithm works with easy to understand explanation and also how to implement it in python programming.
